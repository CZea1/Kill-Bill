-----| Class, Tues. 2/14/2023 |-----
* Created a boilerplate game file in "killbill/"
* Read up on some tutorials and basics for LibGDX
* Created a testing project in "tutorial/camden_testland"
    * Figured out fullscreen mode in desktop mode
    * Rendered a background and two characters
    * Added wall collisions for both characters, and movement over time

-----| Outside of Class, 2/15-2/21 |-----
* Created a Map class which contains functions for drawing the map.
* Created an extensible MapObject object, which represents any object drawn to the screen.
* Created a Tile object for drawing objects in a grid.
* Created a TextureManager object for loading and retrieving textures.
* Created a DebugDisplay class for rendering debugging information.
* Created a KeyChecker class to check for global keypresses.
* Created a GameScreen (as in screen that's used while actively playing) and a TestScreen to implement it.

-----| Class, Tues. 2/21/2023 |-----
* Added collisions that actually work to the player.
* The map can check for collisions against the entire register of objects.
* Added Player and ExtensionKeyChecker objects for the player and checking the player's keys.

-----| Outside of Class, 2/21-2/28 |-----
* Added the main structure for loading maps from files.
* Made the player X and Y use a float for smooth animations. (Probably going to rework this, it's... not great)

-----| Class, Tues. 2/28/2023 |-----
* Fixed a bug which prevented textures and fonts from loading on Windows
* Fixed player collisions, they use floats now

-----| Outside of Class, 2/28-3/7 |-----
* Finished the MapLoader (at least for all objects available now).
* Added backgrounds to maps.
* Add a RAM usage counter to watch for memory leaks. I'm sure it'll be useful sooner or later.
* Made the texture loader recurse through folders.
* Mostly full javadoc coverage.

-----| Class, Tues. 3/7/2023 |-----
* Updated the MapLoader with some new classes
* Added the current viewport implementation, making sure it scales properly across devices

-----| Outside of Class, 3/8-3/21 |-----
* Fixed some bugs in setRotation() which made item rotation only work between 0<x<180
* Made the viewport follow around the player, and the game fills the whole screen now
* Added the inventory system and base Item class

-----| Class, 3/21/2023 |-----
* Worked with Brayden to merge his Weapon implementation (and loot tables) into my Item class.
  Now, weapons can show up in the inventory and be generated by chests.

-----| Outside of Class, 3/22-3/28 |-----
* Added code to check if a user is looking at & within range of another object.
  Used to check if a user wants to interact with an object (ie: chest) or do a melee attack on an enemy.
* Added a DroppedItem object, which allows the user to drop items from their inventory.
  Chests will now automatically drop items if the player's inventory is too full.
* Moved the Chest onCollision code to onInteraction.
* Made Weapons work -- you can now attack enemies, and they disappear when they run out of health.
* Added cooldown logic to Weapons. Cooldown time is rendered over the object.

-----| Class, 3/28/2023 |-----
* Implemented a bunch of the main code for the MenuScreen.
* Ported my old GameScreen class to work with both the regular grid rendering system (game) and fixed rendering system (UI), and made the map screen extend it.

-----| Outside of Class, 3/28-4/4 |-----
* Added the element renderer, which operates on the fixed/UI batch and renders elements to the display (for menus, dialogs, etc).
  * With that, I added buttons, dialogs, and images as elements.
* Added the menu screen. Shows a logo, lets you start the game, and has the ever important Run button.
* Added the intro screen, which shows a logo and tells the story of why the game's objective is to kill Bill.
* Added bombs, and turned the plushie into a powerful explosive.
* Added health bars to enemies.
* Added a hit animation and invincibility to enemies.
* Added javadocs for everything.

-----| Class, 4/4/2023 |-----
* Added tileable backgrounds so that background images won't be stretched anymore.
* Allowed the map loader to load levels recursively so we can use folders to keep everything organized.
* Fixed a bug that prevented bombs from damaging more than one entity.
* Added boilerplate code for projectiles.

-----| Outside of Class, 4/4-4/11 |-----
* Added a renderer for entities and players that makes them change directions, hold items, and have walking animations.
* Added the MicrosoftEmployee enemy, which has 9 different randomized looks.
* Added an item loader, allowing us to set item drops when all enemies die or give enemies items.
* Added keys to doors.
* Added line of sight checks to enemies, so they won't pathfind if they can't see you.

-----| Class, 4/11/2023 |-----
* Fixed the bomb, turns out it didn't actually work.
* Added the security robot. It blows up when you get too close.
* Made the enemies invincible while the voice lines are being spoken to prevent buggy stuff.

-----| Outside of Class, 4/11-4/18 |-----
* Added a "gridscale" system, which allows us to reliably offset or resize objects by part of a tile (used for differently sized doorways right now)

-----| Class, 4/18/2023 |-----
* Worked on adding projectiles to the game.
* Once projectiles worked, I added a Penguin Launcher weapon (haha linux get it) which shoots exploding penguins.

-----| Outside of Class, 4/18-4/25 |-----
Worked on wrapping up some of the core mechanics I still had yet to finish.
* Added shareholders, the last non-boss enemy -- shoots money at you.
* Upgraded menus and the shortcuts that take you between them.
  * Made the death and pause screen show an opaque display of the game behind it.
  * Added button textures.
  * Fixed restarting a game after death.
  * Added logos/headers to all menus.
  * Added a randomized, scary looking background image under the main menu.
* Fixed keys (they didn't actually work), and added textures for doors of all orientations.
* Made loot tables customizable so we can change the odds of certain items appearing by chest.
* Started decorating the main floor.
